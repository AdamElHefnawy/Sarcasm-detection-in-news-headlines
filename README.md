Developed a sarcasm detection model for news headlines, achieving 85.88% accuracy and 0.841 F1-score, surpassing prior benchmarks.
Utilized NLP techniques and models: SVM, LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), and BERT.
BLSTM with early stopping was most effective, capturing bidirectional context in language.
Implemented extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model optimization.

Contributions include enhanced accuracy and potential applications in social media sentiment analysis.
